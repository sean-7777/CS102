== Program
The `compute` function computes the formula, stem:[1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/3 + ... + 1/i].
The helper function, `compute_helper` has three arguments. The `i` argument is for the `i` variable in the formula. The `cur` argument is for the current sum, so that the function can see what to add a new fraction in the formula to. The `target` argument is the target `i` value, this way we can see when we should stop. How this works is that we first check if `i` is equal to `target`, meaning that we should stop, and if so we do not call the helper again, we just return the current value, `cur`. If it is not equal, we call the function again, adding one to `i` because the next fraction's `i` value is one greater, adding the fraction to the current value, and passing in the same target argument.

In `compute` we call the `compute_helper` function with special arguments. For `i` we start at 2 in the formula. For `cur` it is a fraction of zero value. For `target` it is one greater than `i`, because `i` does not start at 1, it starts at 2, and since we are comparing `i` with `target`, we have to add one. In compute we also add one to the result of `compute_helper` because in the formula we have a `1 +` before the fractions.

NOTE: In some terminals the code might not work if your terminal doesn't support Unicode characters. If so, on line 35 of `\\__main__.py` remove the `format_function` call.
