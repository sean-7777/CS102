== Program
This program wasn't actually as hard as I thought it would be. The methods I had to implement were easily implemented by just with a loop, as the `LinkedList` class already had a `\\__iter__` method. 

You will notice that I actually remade the `\\__iter__` because for some reason when I had the `LinkedListIterator` class and I used `enumerate`, `pylint` complained that `Self@LinkedList` was not compatible with the `Iterable[_T@enumerate]` type of the `enumerate` function argument.
