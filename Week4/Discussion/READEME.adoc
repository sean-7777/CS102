== Code
This program probably has been one of the simplest. All the program does is loop through each character in the file and encrypt it by adding 5 to it. Then it writes the result to another file.

== Comments and Observations
Using list comprehension, I can flatten a list, make a list of lists into one big list.
----
flatten([
  [1, 2, 3],
  [4, 5, 6],
  [7, 8, 9],
])
->
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
----
There are several other ways of looping through a matrix, such as a nested loop or `itertools.chain.from_iterable`.
